			<p>Shouten Guide is a project to help small businesses increase their digital presence. With the coronavirus pandemic hitting Japan in 2020 many small businesses are struggling. It's becoming apparent that an online/digital presence is crucial for a business to survive. On top of that big corporations like Amazon are dominating online retail and making it harder for small businesses to succeed.</p>

      <p>With Shouten Guide we would like to help small businesses promote themselves through online map listings and search engine optimization. We would like to provide an online platform to promote local events and foster community spirit which makes shopping districts in Japan so charming. This project is in its early stage but we hope it will help promote and preserve many shoutengai businesses in the future.</p>
