  <h1>About this site</h1>

  <p>
    Shouten Guide is a project to help small businesses increase their digital
    presence. With the coronavirus pandemic hitting Japan in 2020 many small
    businesses are struggling. It's becoming apparent that an online/digital
    presence is crucial for a business to survive. On top of that big
    corporations like Amazon are dominating online retail and making it harder
    for small businesses to succeed.

    With Shouten Guide we would like to help small businesses promote themselves
    through online map listings and search engine optimization. We would like to
    provide an online platform to promote local events and foster community
    spirit which makes shopping districts in Japan so charming. This project is
    in its early stage but we hope it will help promote and preserve many
    shoutengai businesses in the future.
